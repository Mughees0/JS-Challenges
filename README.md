# JavaScript basic coding challenges

#### Please read these carefully:

- The idea of these challenges `is not to google the solution.` try your best thinking how can we solve such problems.

- You should be aware of the `basic syntax + problem solving skills`

- It's better to try your best to figure it out. `do a peer programming with your group mate/s (or go solo)`. think together on how to figure it out and `have fun!`

- Remember, `googling the solution is not what this assignment is expecting`
- Solve as many challenges as you could and write your solutions in `index.js` file

#### The challenges:

- **Find the missing number in an array:** Write a function that takes an array of integers as input, where all numbers in the array are consecutive except for one number that is missing. The function should return the missing number.

- **Find the minimum and maximum numbers in an array:** Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns an object with the minimum and maximum numbers in the array.

- **Find the first non-repeated character in a string:** Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeated character in the string. For example, `"aabbcdd"` should return `"c"`. You can use an object as a lookup directory to count the occurrences of each character in the string.

- **Create a class called `Person` with the following properties and methods:**
  - Properties:
    - `name` (string)
    - `age` (number)
    - `interests` (array of strings)
  - Methods:
    - `greeting()`: returns a string that says "Hi, my name is `name`."
    - `bio()`: returns a string that says "My name is `name`, I'm `age` years old, and my interests are `interests`."

#### Tips on how to solve problems

- Plan what would be the steps to solve the problem
- You should split the problem into multiple steps
- Handle each step at a time as you planned

**Good luck ✌️**
